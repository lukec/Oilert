Oilert is an app to track the movement of tanker ships in Burrard Inlet.

It consists of the following components:

* A web interface to show the current state of ships nearby.
* An API to subscribe and unsubscribe from SMS notifications.
* A script to consume the AIShub.net feed and update our state.

These are briefly explained below.


** Web Interface **

The web application is hosted on the dotCloud platform.  It is written in Perl using the Dancer framework.

The web app uses a Redis database to store information about the ships.
