Oilert is an app to track the movement of tanker ships in Burrard Inlet.

It consists of the following components:

* A web interface to show the current state of ships nearby.
* An API to subscribe and unsubscribe from SMS notifications.
* A script to consume the AIShub.net feed and update our state.

These are briefly explained below.


** Web Interface **

The web application is written in Perl using the Dancer framework.  It is hosted at ais.wildernesscommittee.org.

The web app uses a Redis database to store information about the ships.

** Feed Consumer **

The data feed is supplied by aishub.net as a TCP stream of raw AIS data.  The best reference for this is Eric S. Raymond's Protocol Decoding Guide - http://gpsd.berlios.de/AIVDM.html 

We use a ./bin/ais.py script from Kurt Schwehr - https://github.com/lukec/libais
* It has been modified slightly to ignore types of errors

ais.py emits a json stream which we consume and stick into Redis.


=== INSTALLING ===

Install dependencies first:
* libais https://github.com/lukec/libais
    git clone then: sudo python setup.py install
* Many Perl dependencies listed in Makefile.PL
* Redis

Then you should be able to run the consumer ./bin/consume-aishub
And you should be able to run the web interface in development mode: plackup


With this in place, you can install these services into your environment.
