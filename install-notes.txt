          startup script at /service/oilert-web/run.  Started on boot by
          daemontools automatically.

- aishub consumer - Listens to traffic from data.aishub.net. Started by
          daemontools from /service like the web backend
          Written in Perl, but uses a python ais library to decode messages
          from aishub.

          of the tankers.


Making Changes
==============

The source code lives on github, and in ~oilert/public_html/oilert.  You can
make code changes there, and then run `sudo ./bin/install` which will
copy the files into /home/oilert/public_html/oilert and then restart applicable services.

Make sure to commit your changes back to github once you have them working
and tested.
